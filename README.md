# LinAlg-O-Tron-3000

Are you tired of staring at long lines of text and numbers, God forbid hex dumps, in your terminal all day? </d>
Wouldn't it be better to stare at colorful, rotating, scaling and moving shapes instead? </d>

Well, look no further, as the **LinAlg-O-Tron-3000** is here to spice up your terminal-staring session!
Although they are not colorful (yet) and they are not moving (yet), these shapes are sure fun to look at, so try it today!

### What is the LinAlg-O-Tron-3000?
It is a lightweight, terminal-based Python renderer that visualizes 2D polygon transformations using linear algebra, integer grids, and Braille characters for a retro graphics feel. </d>
It is intended to be a fun side project through which I'm practicing the basics of linear algebra, 2D graphics and rendering. </d>

### What is to come?
Planned features and improvements include:
- Reworking the rendering to be frame based instead of relying on real-time calculations
- Adding color to the shapes.
- Introducing a fixed rendering border instead of dynamic draw-matrix scaling
- I want to add a few more transformations like x/y axial rotation and translation.
</d>

If you want to play with it or help me out with some of these features, please feel free to jump in :)
