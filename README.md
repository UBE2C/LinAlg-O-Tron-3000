# LinAlg-O-Tron-3000

Are you tired of staring at long lines of text and numbers, God forbid Hex dumps in your terminal the whole day? </d>
Wouldn't it be better to stare at colorful, rotating, scaling and moving shapes instead? </d>

Well, look no further, as the LinAlg-O-Tron-3000 is here to spice up your terminal-staring session! Although they are not colorful (yet) and they are not moving (yet), these shapes are sure fun to look at, so try it today!


## What is the LinAlg-O-Tron-3000?
A lightweight, terminal-based Python renderer that visualizes 2D polygon transformations using linear algebra, integer grids, and Braille characters for a retro graphics feel.
